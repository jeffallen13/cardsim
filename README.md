CardSim: a payment card transaction simulator
=======================================================

CardSim is a flexible, scalable Bayesian simulator for payment card fraud detection research. [Allen (2025)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/cardsim-a-bayesian-simulator-for-payment-card-fraud-detection-research.htm) presents the methodology in detail. 

## Setup

### Installing from source

### Local install

After cloning the repository, you can build the package from within the directory
in which the project lives in editable mode. This is recommended if you want to 
make modifications to the code. 

```shell
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use `cardsim` in another project without editing 
the source code, you can install it after pulling the repository. The final 
forward slash is generally optional.

```shell
pip install /path/to/cardsim/
```

### Dependencies

`requirments.txt` lays out the core dependencies and some optional installs 
depending on how you want to use the package. Installing `pandas` and `scipy`
should take care of all core dependencies, including `numpy`, which is used 
extensively. 

## Basic usage

`vignette.py` shows how to use `cardsim`. The simulator generally works as 
follows: 

```python
from cardsim import Cardsim

# Instantiate the class
simulator = Cardsim()

# Run the simulator and store the transaction data
df = simulator.simulate()

# Export the transaction data
simulator.export_transaction_data(df)
```

There are a significant number of parameters for the `Cardsim()` constructor 
and a few options in the `.simulate()` method. Check out the docstrings for more
details. 

## Output fields

The simulator output fields are defined below: 

| Field         | Definition |
|---------------|------------|
| date_time | The transaction datetime; transactions are sorted chronologically |
| payer_id | A unique identifier for the payer | 
| payee_id | A unique identifier for the payee | 
| amount | The payment amount | 
| credit_card | 1 if the payment is made using a credit card and 0 if using a debit card | 
| remote | 1 if the payment is made remotely and 0 if in-person | 
| distance | The Euclidean distance between the payer and payee | 
| fraud | 1 if the payment is fraudulent and 0 if it is legitimate | 

The output also includes several fields related to `date_time`, such as the hour
of day and the date, as well as a `run_id`, which is constructed as: 
`S{seed}P{n_payers}D{n_days}`. For example, a `run_id` could be: S42P500D180. 

## Calibration sources

The simulator is calibrated to several publicly available data sources. The two most important are: 

- [Federal Reserve Payments Study (FRPS)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fr-payments-study.htm): The simulator uses the 2024 FRPS Networks, 
Processors, and Issuers Payments Surveys (NPIPS), which include data from calendar year 2022 (Board of Governors, 2024). 
- [Survey and Diary of Consumer Payment Choice](https://www.atlantafed.org/banking-and-payments/consumer-payments/survey-and-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice): The 
package uses data from the 2022 and 2023 surveys (Foster, Green, and Stavins, 2023, 2024). The data are housed in the `cardsim/dcpc` folder. The vignette shows how to 
load the files. Storing them locally speeds up the simulator. Otherwise, the simulator will attempt to fetch them from the Atlanta Fed's website.
