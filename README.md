CardSim: A Payment Card Transaction Simulator
=======================================================

CardSim is a flexible, scalable Bayesian simulator for payment card fraud detection research. [Allen (2025)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/cardsim-a-bayesian-simulator-for-payment-card-fraud-detection-research.htm) presents the methodology in detail. 

## Setup

### Dependencies

`requirments.txt` lists the core dependencies and some optional installs 
depending on how you want to use the package. Installing `pandas` and `scipy`
should take care of all core dependencies, including `numpy`, which is used 
extensively.

To install all required dependencies, run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing CardSim from Source

You can install `cardsim` directly from GitHub.

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/jeffallen13/cardsim.git
```

### Local Installation

Alternatively, you can install it locally. After cloning the repository, if you 
want to edit the source code, build the package in *editable* mode from within 
the project directory:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

If you prefer to use `cardsim` in another project without editing the source 
code, install it directly from the cloned path:

```shell
pip install /path/to/cardsim/
```

## Basic Usage

`vignette.py` shows how to use `cardsim`. The simulator generally works as 
follows: 

```python
from cardsim import Cardsim

# Instantiate the class
simulator = Cardsim()

# Run the simulator and store the transaction data
df = simulator.simulate()

# Export the transaction data
simulator.export_transaction_data(df)
```

The `Cardsim()` constructor supports numerous parameters, and `.simulate()` has 
additional options. Refer to the docstrings for details.

## Output Fields

The simulator output fields are defined below: 

| Field         | Definition |
|---------------|------------|
| date_time | The transaction datetime; transactions are sorted chronologically |
| payer_id | A unique identifier for the payer | 
| payee_id | A unique identifier for the payee | 
| amount | The payment amount | 
| credit_card | 1 if the payment is made using a credit card and 0 if using a debit card | 
| remote | 1 if the payment is made remotely and 0 if in-person | 
| distance | The Euclidean distance between the payer and payee | 
| fraud | 1 if the payment is fraudulent and 0 if it is legitimate | 

The output also includes several fields related to `date_time`, such as the hour
of day and the date, as well as a `run_id`, which is constructed as: 
`S{seed}P{n_payers}D{n_days}`. For example, a `run_id` could be: S42P500D180. 

## Calibration Sources

The simulator is calibrated to several publicly available data sources. The two most important are: 

- [Federal Reserve Payments Study (FRPS)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fr-payments-study.htm): The simulator uses the 2024 FRPS Networks, 
Processors, and Issuers Payments Surveys (NPIPS), which include data from calendar year 2022 (Board of Governors, 2024). 
- [Survey and Diary of Consumer Payment Choice](https://www.atlantafed.org/banking-and-payments/consumer-payments/survey-and-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice): The 
package uses data from the 2022 and 2023 surveys (Foster, Green, and Stavins, 2023, 2024). The data are located in the `cardsim/dcpc` folder. The vignette shows how to 
load the files. Storing them locally speeds up the simulator. Otherwise, the simulator will attempt to fetch them from the Atlanta Fed's website.
